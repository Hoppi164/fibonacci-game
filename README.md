This is a practice repo for learning Angular9


1. The functionality of this game is sound, and would easily be migrated to a different user interface.
2. This application is essentially "Production Ready" and you can [view a live demo here](https://hoppi164.github.io/fibonacci-game/) 
3. This coding challenge was an interesting concept due to the unexpected problem of solving a computationally difficult fibonacci function, but would benefit from more clear wording on the instructions.




# FibonacciGame

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.1.3.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
There are currently 5 unit tests
* should create app
* should render page
* should have title 'fibonacci game'
* should alert when fib number is entered
* should NOT alert when non-fib number is entered
